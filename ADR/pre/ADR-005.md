# Title

Non-interactive SSH authentication.

## Context

- **Central Server** requires SSH authentication for file transfers.
- File transfer from a processing node to **Central Server** node is based on SSH-SCP.

## Decision

- Use of SSHPASS for non-interactive SSH authentication.

## Status

- Implemented.

## Consequences

- SSHPASS is a tried and tested program from the SSH ecosystem.
- SSHPASS is also run as an operating system command, thus requiring os.system() for running it.
