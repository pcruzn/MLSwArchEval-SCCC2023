# Title

Data copy based on SSH copy (SCP).

## Context

- Component **Training & Testing** running in a processing node needs to communicate results to node **Central Server**.
- **Central Server** is another machine in the same network.

## Decision

- SSH-based file transfer (SCP) is used to transfer results from component **Training & Testing** to node **Central Server**.

## Status

- Implemented.

## Consequences

- SSH-SCP is a well-known, tried and tested alternative for file transfer.
- SSH-SCP is designed for os shell run, not to be called in the context of program code.
