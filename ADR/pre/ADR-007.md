# Title

Metric time elapsed based on time().

## Context

- A metric **time elapsed** is needed for model training performance comparison.

## Decision

- Use Python time() function for determining .

## Status

- Implemented.

## Consequences

- Python time() returns time from epoch which is a standard way of indicating current time.
- time() is risky in distributed environments for precise elapsed time calculation.
