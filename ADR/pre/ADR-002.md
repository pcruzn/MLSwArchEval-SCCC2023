# Title

Command-and-control approach for model training and testing.

## Context

- The **Training & Testing** component follows a train & test approach which is standard and follows a command-and-control approach.
- The software started as a research and innovative endeavor.

## Decision

- Component **Training & Testing** commands and controls the running of components **Models, Shared Library** and **Losses and Metrics.**

## Status

- Implemented.

## Consequences

- Following and undestanding domain logic is easy with command and control approach.
- The command-and-control approach increases coupling between components. In practice, the ML Engineer spends if one of the components fail.
- Command-and-control approach is not easy to maintain in this distributed context.
